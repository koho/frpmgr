## :gear: Build

#### Install dependencies
- go >=1.16
- Visual Studio
- [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)
- [WiX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/)

#### Setup environment

1. Add `vcvars64.bat` to the `PATH` environment variable. Usually the directory is:
- `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build`

2. Make sure the `bin` directory of MinGW is added to the `PATH` environment variable.

3. Make sure the environment variable `WIX` is set to the Wix installation directory.

#### Compile

```shell
git clone https://github.com/koho/frpmgr
cd frpmgr
build.bat
```

Find the generated installation files in the `bin` directory.

#### Debugging

The build process needs to render icons to generate resources and patch some files, all of which are done in `build.bat`. 
Therefore, this script needs to be run once before the first debugging, and the subsequent debugging does not need to execute the script again.
