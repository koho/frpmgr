## :gear: Build

#### Install dependencies

- Go
- Visual Studio
- [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)
- [WiX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/)

#### Setup environment

1. Add `vcvarsall.bat` to the `PATH` environment variable. Usually the directory is:

   `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build`

2. Make sure the `bin` directory of MinGW is added to the `PATH` environment variable.

3. Make sure the environment variable `WIX` is set to the Wix installation directory.

#### Compile

```shell
git clone https://github.com/koho/frpmgr
cd frpmgr
build.bat
```

Find the generated installation files in the `bin` directory.

#### Debugging

When building the project for the first time, you need to render the icon and generate resources:

```shell
go generate
```

The above command does not need to be run for every build, it just needs to be executed again when the resource changes.

After the command is completed, the program can be run directly:

```shell
go run ./cmd/frpmgr
```
